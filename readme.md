# N328 Final Project - Marco Ramirez

## hello!

this is my n328 d3.js visualization. i decided to visualize a comparison of the price per gallon of all grades of gas (regular, medium, premium) to diesel prices.

the link to the presentation video is [here](https://youtu.be/ylvESYgju1I). 

the link to original excel file, as well as where I got the information from is [here](https://www.eia.gov/dnav/pet/pet_pri_gnd_dcus_nus_a.htm).

thank you to professor reda for giving me an extra day to do this project. without that extra day, this would be a very ugly, nonfunctional project. i appreciate you more than you know.

thank you!
