        <h1>Comparing Gas Prices</h1>
        <p class="container"> &emsp; &emsp;For my data visualization project, I wasn't quite sure what to do. 
            I searched around for a few days, and couldn't find a dataset that I as truly passionate about. 
            I continued to think at work, as I drove, and as I existed. Then, the idea struck me. As I filled
            my car's gas tank, I started to think about two years ago, when gas was cheap. I then started to ponder
            how cheap it was 10 years ago, and then 20. Finally, I had an idea. Using D3.js, I decidede to visualize
            how gas prices have changed through the years, as well as comparing the prices <u> per gallon </u>of "All Grades"
            (regular, medium, premium), as well as the prices of "Diesel". Here is the visualization.
